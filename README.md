# Split-Bills-Minimum-Number-of-Transactions-
A mini project based on data structures for splitting bills and reducing the number of transactions among a group of people. The algorithm is implemented using HashMap and Multiset from the C++ STL. Using this mini project, we can determine the minimal number of transactions and who must pay how much to whom.
